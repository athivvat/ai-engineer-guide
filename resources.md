# Artificial Intelligence Resources

### Getting Started in Artificial Intelligence
1. [Intro to AI (UC Berkeley)](http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html): This could be considered the premier, pioneering, online-oriented, open-access university level AI course in existence.
2. [Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques (Stanford)](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs221/2016/): This open offering from Stanford has this to say on its website:

> What is this course about? What do web search, speech recognition, face recognition, machine translation, autonomous driving, and automatic scheduling have in common? These are all complex real-world problems, and the goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to tackle these with rigorous mathematical tools. In this course, you will learn the foundational principles that drive these applications and practice implementing some of these systems.
3. [Reinforcement Learning](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html): This is David Silver's renowned reinforcement learning course from University College London. The material is concise, consisting of both lecture videos and corresponding slides, the combination of which is packed with information.
4. [Deep Reinforcement Learning (UC Berkeley)](http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/): Taught by Sergey Levine, John Schulman, and Chelsea Finn, this course is another take on reinforcement learning. The course is presently ongoing, with new lectures being streamed live as they happen, and available afterward as well.
5. [Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars (MIT)](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/): This course has been making a splash online since going live, an MIT course on self-driving cars led by Lex Fridman.
