# Problem Solving

## Overview

This chapter explores systematic approaches to problem-solving in AI, focusing on search algorithms and state space representations.

## Problem-Solving Framework

### Problem Definition
- **Initial state**: Starting point
- **Goal state**: Desired outcome
- **Actions**: Available operations
- **State space**: All possible states
- **Path cost**: Cost of solution sequence

### State Space Search
- Representing problems as graphs
- Nodes represent states
- Edges represent actions
- Solution as path from initial to goal state

## Uninformed Search Strategies

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Explores all nodes at current depth before going deeper
- **Advantages**: Optimal for unweighted graphs, complete
- **Disadvantages**: High memory requirements
- **Time Complexity**: O(b^d)
- **Space Complexity**: O(b^d)

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Explores as far as possible along each branch
- **Advantages**: Lower memory requirements
- **Disadvantages**: Not optimal, can get stuck in infinite paths
- **Time Complexity**: O(b^m)
- **Space Complexity**: O(bm)

### Uniform Cost Search
- Expands node with lowest path cost
- Optimal for weighted graphs
- Similar to Dijkstra's algorithm

### Iterative Deepening Search
- Combines benefits of BFS and DFS
- Gradually increases depth limit
- Optimal and memory-efficient

## Informed Search Strategies

### Heuristic Functions
- Admissible heuristics (never overestimate)
- Consistent heuristics (monotonic)
- Designing effective heuristics

### A* Search
- Uses f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
- g(n): actual cost from start
- h(n): heuristic estimate to goal
- Optimal with admissible heuristics

### Greedy Best-First Search
- Uses only heuristic function
- Fast but not optimal
- Can get trapped in local optima

### Hill Climbing
- Local search algorithm
- Moves to neighboring state with best value
- Variants: steepest ascent, first-choice, random restart

## Advanced Search Techniques

### Simulated Annealing
- Probabilistic algorithm
- Allows worse moves to escape local optima
- Temperature parameter controls exploration

### Genetic Algorithms
- Population-based search
- Evolution through selection, crossover, mutation
- Good for optimization problems

### Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)
- Variables with domains and constraints
- Backtracking search with inference
- Arc consistency and forward checking

## Applications

- **Route planning and navigation**
- **Game playing (chess, Go)**
- **Puzzle solving (8-puzzle, Sudoku)**
- **Scheduling and resource allocation**
- **Circuit design and optimization**

## Key Concepts to Master

- Search tree vs. state space
- Optimality, completeness, time/space complexity
- Heuristic design and admissibility
- Local vs. global search strategies
- Constraint propagation techniques
