# Intelligent Agents

## Overview

This chapter covers the fundamental concepts of intelligent agents in artificial intelligence, including their design principles, architectures, and applications.

## What are Intelligent Agents?

An intelligent agent is an entity that perceives its environment and takes actions to achieve specific goals. Key characteristics include:

- **Perception**: Ability to sense the environment
- **Action**: Capability to affect the environment
- **Goal-oriented**: Works toward achieving specific objectives
- **Autonomy**: Operates independently

## Types of Agents

### Simple Reflex Agents
- React to current percept only
- Use condition-action rules
- No memory of past events

### Model-based Reflex Agents
- Maintain internal state
- Track world changes over time
- Make decisions based on current state

### Goal-based Agents
- Consider future consequences
- Plan actions to achieve goals
- More flexible than reflex agents

### Utility-based Agents
- Maximize expected utility
- Handle conflicting goals
- Make optimal decisions under uncertainty

## Agent Architectures

### Reactive Architectures
- Fast response to environmental changes
- Limited reasoning capabilities
- Suitable for dynamic environments

### Deliberative Architectures
- Complex reasoning and planning
- Slower response times
- Better for complex problem-solving

### Hybrid Architectures
- Combine reactive and deliberative approaches
- Balance speed and reasoning capability
- Most common in real-world applications

## Applications

- **Autonomous vehicles**
- **Game playing agents**
- **Recommendation systems**
- **Chatbots and virtual assistants**
- **Trading algorithms**

## Key Concepts to Master

- Agent environments (PEAS description)
- Rationality and performance measures
- Environment properties (observability, determinism, etc.)
- Agent communication and multi-agent systems
