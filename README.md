# Artificial Intelligence Engineer Roadmap

## Overview
This is resources for going from software engineer/non-software engineer to profressional in AI engineer.

## About Me
I'm a Thai Software Engineer who is really passionate to become entrepreneur, investor, and AI engineer. Was found Humaan.ai to bringing the AI to everyone to do incredible ways. 

Currently, I'm studying for a master's degree in Business Analytics and Data Sciences, where majoring in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning  at [National Institute of Development Administration (NIDA)](http://www.nida.ac.th/en/), Thailand.

## Computer Vision
-  [Motion Heatmap Using OpenCV in Python](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/motion-heatmap-using-opencv-in-python) : This sample application is useful to see movement patterns over time. For example, it could be used to see the usage of entrances to a factory floor over time, or patterns of shoppers in a store.
- [Few-Shot vid2vid by NVIDIA](https://github.com/NVlabs/few-shot-vid2vid) : Pytorch implementation for few-shot photorealistic video-to-video translation. It can be used for generating human motions from poses, synthesizing people talking from edge maps, or turning semantic label maps into photo-realistic videos. The core of video-to-video translation is image-to-image translation. Some of our work in that space can be found in pix2pixHD and SPADE.
- [Gaussian YOLOv3: An Accurate and Fast Object Detector for Autonomous Driving](https://github.com/jwchoi384/Gaussian_YOLOv3) : Gaussian YOLOv3: An Accurate and Fast Object Detector Using Localization Uncertainty for Autonomous Driving (ICCV, 2019)
- [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) : Real-time multi-person keypoint detection library for body, face, hands, and foot estimation

## Natural Language Processing
- [T5: Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer) : Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer
